This is our project for the hackathon. The game runs from the Unity engine. The code is in C# and uploaded to GitHub. Since we had too many
files to upload to GitHub (We exceeded the limit), the rest of the code files and unused code can be found through this link: _____

The link also includes an executable file of the game. It can run on any Windows device. 

We created this game as a way to educate people about the Novel Coronavirus pandemic in a way that is engaging and fun.  Players explore a 3D world where they can either fight a disease or try to spread it.  Along the way, they collect information about virus transmission, symptoms, and prevention.

Implementation:
-Models created in Blender
-Premade assets (houses from free3.com)
-Textures from Poliigon added to models
-Rendered with shading and other tools built into in Unity
-Game implemented in Unity
-Coded in C#
